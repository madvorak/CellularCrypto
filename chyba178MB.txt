ContextSwitchDeadlock occurred
Message: Managed Debugging Assistant 'ContextSwitchDeadlock' has detected a problem in 'C:\Martin\MFF\_baka\Program\bin\Debug\Program.exe'.
Additional information: The CLR has been unable to transition from COM context 0x96d910 to COM context 0x96d7a0 for 60 seconds. The thread that owns the destination context/apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping Windows messages. This situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time. To avoid this problem, all single threaded apartment (STA) threads should use pumping wait primitives (such as CoWaitForMultipleHandles) and routinely pump messages during long running operations.
